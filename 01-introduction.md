# Machine Learning vs Traditional Programming
Say that we wanted to write an application to manage an ecommerce platform.

To build the brains of our application, weʼd have to step through every possible corner case that we anticipate encountering, devising appropriate rules.

Imagine huddling around the whiteboard with the smartest minds you know, but this time you are tackling one of the following problems:
- Write a program that predicts tomorrowʼs weather given geographic information, satellite images, and a trailing window of past weather.
- Write a program that takes in a question, expressed in free-form text, and answers it correctly.
- Write a program that given an image can identify all the people it contains, drawing outlines around each.
- Write a program that presents users with products that they are likely to enjoy but unlikely, in the natural course of browsing, to encounter.

In each of these cases, even elite programmers are incapable of coding up solutions from scratch.

Our deterministic ecommerce platform, which performs according to the same business logic, no matter how much experience accrues, until the developers themselves learn and decide that it is time to update the software.

**We need our programs to adapt**.

# What is Machine Learning?
ML is the study of powerful techniques that can learn from experience.
- As an ML algorithm accumulates more experience, typically in the form of observational data or interactions with an environment, its performance improves.

# What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is just one among many popular methods for solving machine learning problems.
- Deep models are deep in precisely the sense that they learn many layers of computation.

# Depp Learnig vs Traditional Learning
- One key advantage of deep learning is that it replaces not only the shallow models at the end of traditional learning pipelines, but also the labor-intensive process of feature engineering.
- Second,  deep learning has eliminated many of the boundaries that previously separated computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, medical informatics, and other application areas, offering a unified set of tools for tackling diverse problems.
