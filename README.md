# Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai)

**The first part covers basics and preliminaries.**  
1. **Chapter1:** offers an introduction to deep learning.
1. **Chapter2:** we quickly bring you up to speed on the prerequisites required for hands-on deep learning, such as how to store and manipulate data, and how to apply various numerical operations based on basic concepts from linear algebra, calculus, and probability.
1. **Chapter3 and Chapter4** cover the most basic concepts and techniques of deep learning, such as linear regression, multilayer perceptrons and regularization.

**The next five chapters focus on modern deep learning techniques.**
1. **Chapter5** describes the various key components of deep learning calculations and lays the groundwork for us to subsequently implement more complex models.
1. **Chapter6 and Chapter7**, we introduce convolutional neural networks (CNNs), powerful tools that form the backbone of most modern computer vision systems.
1. **Chapter8 and Chapter9**, we introduce recurrent neural networks (RNNs), models that exploit temporal or sequential structure in data, and are commonly used for natural language processing and time series prediction.
1. **Chapter10**, we introduce a new class of models that employ a technique called attention mechanisms and they have recently begun to displace RNNs in natural language processing.

**Part three discusses scalability, efficiency, and applications.**
1. **Chapter11**, we discuss several common optimization algorithms used to train deep learning models.
1. **Chapter12** examines several key factors that influence the computational performance of your deep learning code.
1. **Chapter13**, we illustrate major applications of deep learning in computer vision.
1. **Chapter14 and Chapter15**, we show how to pretrain language representation models and apply them to natural language processing tasks.

To successfully apply deep learning, you must understand how to cast a problem, the mathematics of modeling, the algorithms for fitting your models to data, and the engineering techniques to implement it all.
