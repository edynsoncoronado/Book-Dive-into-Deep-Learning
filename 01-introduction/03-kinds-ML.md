# Supervised learning
- Supervised learning addresses the task of predicting targets given inputs.
	- The targets, which we often call labels, are generally denoted by **y**.
	- The input data, also called the features or covariates, are typically denoted **x**.
	- Each (input, target) pair is called an example or instance.
		- We denote any particular instance with a subscript, typically **i**, for instance (x<sub>i</sub> , y<sub>i</sub>).
